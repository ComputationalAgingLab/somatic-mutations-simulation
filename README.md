# Dynamical system modelling of somatic mutations accumulation 

This repository contains code and all of the calculations from the paper: LINK TO BE ADDED

## Description (TO BE UPDATED)
This repository contains the code and calculations for dynamical systems models of somatic mutation accumulation in tissues.  
We have developed an incremental approach for the evaluation of somatic mutations impact on the aging process, in which multiple models, that are gradually becoming more complex, allow us to model individual tissue aging trajectory based on the several biological parameters. 

## Installation
You can create conda environment from .yml file.
```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ComputationalAgingLab/somatic-mutations-simulation.git
cd somatic-mutations-simulation

# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate it
conda activate somamut
```
